        After just three days,
        <strong>Whiskers can now create web pages</strong> better than
        <em>I</em> can!
      </p>

      <p>
        It all started when Whiskers, my ever-curious cat, sat on my keyboard
        during a coding session. Instead of shooing him away, I decided to take
        advantage of his interest. Little did I know, Whiskers had a knack for
        coding!
      </p>

        By the end of day one, he was familiar with basic tags like
        &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;. On day two, he was
        creating paragraphs and lists. By day three, he had moved on to creating
        stunning layouts with &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt;.
      </p>

        "HTML is <strong>elementary</strong> my dear Watson."<br />
        <cite>&mdash; Whiskers, probably</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>He's now accepting freelance projects.</p>

      <p>
        A timeless red orb<br />
        floats lazy in the ether<br />
        unimpressed by war.

        If there's one thing in this world that brings pure, unadulterated joy,
        it's <del>vegetables</del> <ins>donuts</ins>. Let's face it, these
        delightful rings of sugary perfection are the ultimate comfort food, and
        here's why.
