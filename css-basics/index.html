      <h1>Planets of the Solar System</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        <span class="caps">Our solar system</span> is a vast and fascinating
        place, consisting of the Sun and the various celestial bodies that orbit
        it, including eight major planets. Each planet offers unique
        characteristics and features. In this article, we will explore the
        distinctive attributes of each planet, providing an overview of what
        makes them unique (and learn a little
        <abbr title="Cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr> while doing it).
      </p>

      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in our
        solar system. It has a very thin atmosphere and its surface is covered
        with craters.
      </p>

      <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is known for its thick,
        toxic atmosphere and extreme surface temperatures. It's often called
        Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size and composition.
      </p>

      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to
        support life. It has a diverse climate and surface, with large bodies of
        water, mountains, and forests.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
          rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in
          glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a
          fraction of a dot.
        </p>
        <cite>â€” Carl Sagan</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Mars</h2>
      <p>
        Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet"
        due to its reddish appearance. It has the largest volcano and canyon in
        the solar system.
      </p>

      <h2>Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the solar
        system. It has a Great Red Spot, which is a giant storm, and dozens of
        moons.
      </p>

      <h2>Saturn</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is famous for its extensive ring
        system. It's the second-largest planet in the solar system.
      </p>

      <h2>Uranus</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and has a unique blue-green
        color due to methane in its atmosphere. It rotates on its side, making
        it unique among the planets.
      </p>

      <h2>Neptune</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our
        solar system. It's known for its deep blue color and strong winds, some
        of the fastest in the solar system.
